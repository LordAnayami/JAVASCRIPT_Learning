Examples: More Component Ideas
With the concepts covered thus far, you're already able to build some interesting non-trivial components in a type-safe way.

Here are some examples:

A Card Component That Has Multiple "Slots"

Full code (with example usage): https://github.com/academind/react-typescript-course-resources/blob/main/examples/Card.tsx

A reusable Card component that does not just accept the children prop but instead also accepts an actions prop which receives JSX as value.

It may be used like this:

<Card
  title="My Card"
  actions={
    <button onClick={() => console.log('Button clicked!')}>
      Click Me!
    </button>
   }
  >
  <p>Some content</p>
</Card>
A Button Component That Accepts Text & An Icon

Full code (with example usage): https://github.com/academind/react-typescript-course-resources/blob/main/examples/IconButton.tsx

A reusable IconButton component which will output text side-by-side next to a configurable icon (or actually any component). It accepts an icon prop which wants a component identifier as a value.

It may be used like this:

<IconButton icon={HeartIcon} onClick={() => console.log('Button clicked!')}>
  Like
</IconButton>
A Generic List Component

Full code (with example usage): https://github.com/academind/react-typescript-course-resources/blob/main/examples/List.tsx

A reusable List component which outputs an <ul> that wraps a list that may output any kind of value (strings, numbers, objects, ...). The component accepts the items as a prop as well as a renderItem prop that expects to get a function that controls how each item should be rendered.

It may be used like this:

<main>
  <section>
    <h2>Users</h2>
    <List
      items={users}
      renderItem={(user) => <li key={user.id}>{user.name}</li>}
    />
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <List
      items={hobbies}
      renderItem={(hobby) => <li key={hobby}>{hobby}</li>}
    />
  </section>
</main>
